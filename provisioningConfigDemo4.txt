--Provisioning--

All necessary functions reside in Provisioning.hs.  ProvisioningMain has all the necessary function invocations (all but one commented out for each particular desired provisioning activity).

-ekProvision:  Extracts the EK(Endorsement Key) from the currently running TPM Emulator, and exports it to the file "ekpub.txt".  

1) Must be run on the Attester VM while TPM Emulator is running.  
2) Send "ekpub.txt" to the Certificate Authority VM (so that it can use the EK to encrypt the AIK, in accordance with the Privacy CA protocol).

-exportCurrentComp:  Queries the running TPM Emulator and extracts the CURRENT pcr composite(TPM_PCR_COMPOSITE), and exports it to the file "goldenPcrComposite.txt".  

1) Must be run on the Attester VM while TPM Emulator is running.  
2) Send "goldenPcrComposite" to the Appraiser VM (so that it can check this golden composite against the one it receives from the Attester in the protocol).

exportCAKeys:  Exports the CA public key to the file "caPublicKey.txt" and the CA private key to the file "caPrivateKey.txt".  (Note:  A NEW public/private key pair is generated on each invocation, using the system entropy).

1) Can be run anywhere, but makes the most sense to run on the certificate authority VM.
2)  The private key file should remain on the ca VM
3)  Send the public key file to the Appraiser VM (so that it can verify the signature of the data signed with the ca private key).
